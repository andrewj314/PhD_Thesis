  abstract={The electromagnetic calorimeter of CMS (ECAL) is a hermetic, fine grained and homogeneous calorimeter containing 75848 lead-tungstate (PbWO 4 ) crystals, completed by a silicon preshower installed in front of the endcaps. The ECAL sensitivity to decay modes with electromagnetic objects in the final state, such as narrow resonances decaying into two photons, is achieved through its excellent energy and position resolution. The ECAL performance from 2010–2012 is presented in detail and its role in the hunt for the Higgs boson, through the 2-photon decay mode, is discussed.}

@article{Muon,
  author={The CMS collaboration},
  title={The performance of the CMS muon detector in proton-proton collisions at √ s = 7 TeV at the LHC},
  journal={Journal of Instrumentation},

  pages={P11002},
  url={http://stacks.iop.org/1748-0221/8/i=11/a=P11002},
  year={2013},
  abstract={The performance of all subsystems of the CMS muon detector has been studied by using a sample of proton-proton collision data at √ s = 7 TeV collected at the LHC in 2010 that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 40 pb -1 . The measured distributions of the major operational parameters of the drift tube (DT), cathode strip chamber (CSC), and resistive plate chamber (RPC) systems met the design specifications. The spatial resolution per chamber was 80–120 μm in the DTs, 40–150 μm in the CSCs, and 0.8–1.2 cm in the RPCs. The time resolution achievable was 3 ns or better per chamber for all 3 systems. The efficiency for reconstructing hits and track segments originating from muons traversing the muon chambers was in the range 95–98%. The CSC and DT systems provided muon track segments for the CMS trigger with over 96% efficiency, and identified the correct triggering bunch crossing in over 99.5% of such events. The measured performance is well reproduced by Monte Carlo simulation of the muon system down to the level of individual channel response. The results confirm the high efficiency of the muon system, the robustness of the design against hardware failures, and its effectiveness in the discrimination of backgrounds.}

The detector was installed in summer 2008, commissioned with charge injections, and operated in the 3.8 T magnetic field during cosmic ray data taking. This paper reports on the first running experience and presents results on the pixel tracker performance, which are found to be in line with the design specifications of this detector. The transverse impact parameter resolution measured in a sample of high momentum muons is 18 microns.}

  abstract={A description is provided of the software algorithms developed for the CMS tracker both for reconstructing charged-particle trajectories in proton-proton interactions and for using the resulting tracks to estimate the positions of the LHC luminous region and individual primary-interaction vertices. Despite the very hostile environment at the LHC, the performance obtained with these algorithms is found to be excellent. For t ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/bart.gif] {bar t} events under typical 2011 pileup conditions, the average track-reconstruction efficiency for promptly-produced charged particles with transverse momenta of p T > 0.9GeV is 94% for pseudorapidities of |η| < 0.9 and 85% for 0.9 < |η| < 2.5. The inefficiency is caused mainly by hadrons that undergo nuclear interactions in the tracker material. For isolated muons, the corresponding efficiencies are essentially 100%. For isolated muons of p T  = 100GeV emitted at |η| < 1.4, the resolutions are approximately 2.8% in p T , and respectively, 10μm and 30μm in the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters. The position resolution achieved for reconstructed primary vertices that correspond to interesting pp collisions is 10–12μm in each of the three spatial dimensions. The tracking and vertexing software is fast and flexible, and easily adaptable to other functions, such as fast tracking for the trigger, or dedicated tracking for electrons that takes into account bremsstrahlung.}
