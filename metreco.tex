\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\MET$}{Missing transverse energy}}\label{ss:met}

The presence of neutrinos in the $\tau\tau$ decays must be inferred from the imbalance of total momentum because they escape from the detector without producing 
any direct response. The magnitude of the negative vector sum of the visible transverse momentum is known as missing transverse energy, denoted $\MET$.

Missing transverse energy is one of the most important observables for discriminating the signal events from background events which do not contain neutrinos, 
such as QCD multijet and DY$\to\mu\mu$/ee events.
Because there are many factors which may result in artificial $\MET$, comprehensive studies of $\MET$ as measured using the CMS detector have been 
performed~\cite{MET}. We require events with $\MET >$ 30 GeV in all channels.

Finally, the standard and recommended ``MET Filters" are utilized in this search.
