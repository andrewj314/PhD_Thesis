\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

Two searches for heavy neutral resonances, $Z\prime$s, decaying to back-to-back tau pairs are carried out using the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The first, carried out during the 2012 data-taking run at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV, focuses on the fully-leptonic channel, in which one tau decays to an electron and the other to a muon. The second, carried out during the 2015 run at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, focuses on the fully-hadronic channel, in which each tau decays to a hadronic jet. Each search employs a hybrid of background estimation strategies using both Monte Carlo simulation and data-driven methods. In both searches, observed data is found to be in agreement with Standard Model expectation and no excesses are observed. Limits are placed on the $Z\prime$, culminating in a world-record limit of 2.2 TeV at $95\%$ confidence level.
